# SFML Physics Engine 

It's not going to be very good, but want to work on some gravity and fluid simulations as a side project now that I have taken linear algebra, physics, and some more advanced CS classes. Also given that 
I am not the best programmer in the world I will be using online resources, which I will cite below. Feel free to comment/let me know of any issues. Thank you

Resources used:
invSquared funtion from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fast-inverse-square-root/
A lot of early inspo from https://github.com/womogenes/GravitySim
